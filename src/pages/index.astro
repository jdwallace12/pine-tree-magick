        description:
          'Your birth time is essential for an astrology reading because it determines the exact placement of the four angles in astrology, including your Ascendent (or rising sign) which determines the rest of your chart. Even a small difference in birth time can significantly change the chart, so having the correct time ensures the insights are correct.',

          'Astrology doesn’t predict the future in a fixed or fatalistic way but instead provides insights into the energetic cycles and patterns that might influence your life. It highlights opportunities, challenges, and themes you’re likely to experience, helping you make informed decisions and align with the flow of these cosmic energies. Ultimately, your free will plays a central role in shaping your future, and astrology serves as a guide to empower you along the way.',

          'This depends on your needs and goals. A full natal chart reading is typically a one-time session, offering deep insights into your life’s patterns, strengths, and purpose. After that, you might choose to have follow-up readings for transits, solar return charts, or electional astrology. Ultimately, it’s about what feels supportive and beneficial for you. Regular readings can help you stay aligned with the cosmic flow and make the most of the cycles in your life.',
