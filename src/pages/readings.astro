    <p class="text-lg dark:text-slate-400">Private sessions serve as containers for connection and personal growth. Each online session begins with a Tarot card message from Spirit. From there, I'll move through your chart to identify prevalent cycles, opportunities, and insights.</p>
    <p class="text-lg dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">After our session ends, I'll send a ritual practice tailored to you and your current circumstances. The ritual I create will reflect our time together, as I intuitively choose crystals, plant allies, and cosmic energies that are calling your name. Each ritual includes a recorded meditation, journal prompts, bespoke altar suggestions, and a step-by-step ritual designed to align you with your cosmic path.</p>
    <p class="text-lg dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">Private sessions are perfect for anyone seeking real-time connection and collaboration. It's ideal for those who crave reflection and actionable guidance, and are interested in the art of ritual. An audio file of our time together is included with this package.</p>
