Lead a guided visualization where participants look into the mirror and imagine themselves glowing with radiant light. Guide them to see their reflection transform into the most confident, loving version of themselves.

“As you gaze into the mirror, see your reflection begin to shine with golden light. This is the version of you who believes in your strength, loves without conditions, and radiates kindness. What does this version of you feel like? What would they say to you right now?”
