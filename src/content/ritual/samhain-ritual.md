During Samhain, the veil is particularly thin. Even if you have no experience with spirit connection, this guided ritual takes you through all the steps to connect to your most healed ancestors. Ancestral connection is a powerful tool for healing generational trauma, allowing for more healing, peace, and protection in your life. This ritual package includes two guided meditations, journal prompts for receiving chanelled messages, Samhain altar suggestions, and a step-by-step ritual to help you to receive ancestral blessings. Although ancestral connection can be practiced anytime, the Samhain portal is open between October 31 and November 7 and is the perfect time start this practice.
