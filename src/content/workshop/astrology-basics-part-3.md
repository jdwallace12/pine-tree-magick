Let's build on the foundation from Week 1 and dive deeper into how the planets in your chart shape your everyday experiences. We'll decode the influence of Venus to understand your approach to relationships, Mars to uncover your sources of motivation and drive, Jupiter to explore where growth comes naturally, and Saturn to reveal areas where you may encounter limitations or challenges. 

This session will empower you to work with the personal planets to enhance self-awareness and gain a deeper understanding of your chart and its natal promise.




**No prior knowledge of astrology is needed, but a correct birth time and birth place is a requirement for this workshop.**
