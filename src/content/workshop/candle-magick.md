Join me for a cozy gathering of magick-making, intention setting, crafting, tea, and conversation! This hands-on candle magick workshop will guide you through the process of creating your own magickal sigil and carving and anointing candles to bring a dream to fruition.

### During this workshop, you'll:

- Learn how to create your own magickal sigil
- Carve and anoint candles with intention
- Harness the power of herbs and plant magick
- Receive guidance on integrating magick into your daily life
- Leave with a multi-day candle specifically created to manifest your desire

Each participant will receive a printed workbook that contains a list of magickal correspondences for future reference and tea will be served by Botanically Curious. Whether you love a good craft project or are interested in integrating a little more magick into your daily life, this workshop is for you! All are welcome, regardless or experience or expertise.
